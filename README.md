# Object Detection with YOLOv3
 Object Detection - as quite the name suggests is detecting objects in an image or video through Deep Learning Algorithms. The motive of object detection is to recognize and locate (localize) all known objects in a scene. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them.

I used the YOLO (You only live once) algorithm for Object Detection. YOLO is a clever convolutional neural network (CNN) for doing object detection in real-time. The Algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image, and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.

My results looked something like
